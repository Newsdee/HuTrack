

The note is stored as a linear frequency component. All operations are done
in the linear frequency domain, and then converted to PCE's period system.

The internal format of the note:

      octave:note:noteCent

      noteCent = 0 to 255
      note     = 0 to 11
      octave   = 0 to 7

There is only one linear note frequency to period table, and the table is for
octave 0 only. Since all octaves are power of 2, the period value for said note
is simply shifted octave number of times.
